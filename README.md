**The project is currently WIP ... more information, build instructions and public Snap!-project will be available soon.**

A LEGO® Education SPIKE robot capable of solving a physical RubiksCube ®, interlaced with a digital twin: a virtual cube model developed in Snap! that controls the physical robot instantaneously.

This project demonstrates how real-time digital twins can transform computer-science education by linking a virtual Rubik’sCube® model in Snap! directly to a LEGO® SPIKE robot (buildable with a single SPIKE Prime Education Kit) — complete with live synchronization (via serial communication) of moves and sensor feedback powered by a lightweight machine-learning color classifier—offering a hands-on platform for students to investigate physical computing, algorithm design, and AI concepts in a single cohesive system. Its modular architecture makes it easy to adapt for diverse learning environments, from introductory algorithm exercises to advanced explorations of modeling, abstraction, and robotics.

We've added a glare shield to the color sensor for better sensing performance. The corresponding .stl-File can be found in the repository.
